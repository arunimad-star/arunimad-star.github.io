              <p>Hi! My name is Arunima Deval and I am a student at UC Berkeley studying Economics and Chemical Biology in the College of Chemistry. I am from Seattle and Portland and I am incredibly passionate about investing.</p>
              <p>I currently work for Affinity Asset Advisors, a biotech and healthcare focused fund ($2B AUM), and lead the Healthcare Pod at Berkeley Investment Group. I was also a Top 6 finalist at the Point 72 Case Competition and have done research in several labs. I am currently an undergraduate researcher in the He Lab at UC Berkeley studying endogenous retroviruses (ancient viral sequences embedded in non coding DNA in the genome) involved in RNA binding and abscission during cell division. On the side, I&apos;ve built a stock screener that filters NASDAQ/NYSE tickers based on Feshbach, Robertson, Porter, and DiMenna strategies.</p>
              <p>Always happy to chat so please feel free to reach out!</p>
